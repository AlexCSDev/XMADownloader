# Configuring Google Drive plugin
In order to use google drive plugin you need to configure a few things:

 1. Go to the https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/dotnet
 2. Press "Enable the Drive API" button
 3. Select "Desktop app" and press "Create"
 4. Press "DOWNLOAD CLIENT CONFIGURATION" button
 5. Rename downloaded file to gd_credentials.json and put it into the XMADownloader folder
 6. As soon as needed XMADownloader will open authorization dialog where you would need to login into your google drive account and allow "Quickstart" application access to your account. **Don't worry, no one will be able to access your account data as you are using your own client credentials.**
