# Configuring Mega.nz plugin
This plugin will work without any additional configuration with all download limits enforced by the service. 

If you have premium account you can configure it by renaming mega_credentials_example.json into mega_credentials.json and setting your email and password there. Invalid email and password will prevent mega files from being downloaded.
